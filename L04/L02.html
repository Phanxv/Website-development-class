    <h1>Elements of a Java Application</h1>
    <p id="txtID">I <span class="txt blk blk1 wrd">understand</span> that you are eager to type some code in your editor
        and run it to see your first Java application in action! Do not worry, your expectation will be fulfilled by the
        end of this tutorial. But before we move on, I would like to do through several elements that you need to know
        to fully understand what you are doing.</p>
    <h1 class="txt txt1 txt3">Compiling and Executing Java Code</h1>
    <p class="txt blk blk1 wrd1">There are several steps that you need to follow to create a Java application. This
        tutorial shows you how to create a very simple Java application. If you need to create an enterprise
        application, the creation process is more complex but at its core you will find these simple steps. The first of
        these steps is to write some Java code in a text editor.</p>
    <h1 class="txt txt1 txt3">Creating a First Java Class</h1>
    <p class="txt blk blk1 wrd2">The first step you need to know is that the Java code you are writing is saved in plain
        text files. In this tutorial, your application will be written in a single text file. Larger applications may
        require thousands of such files. Java is an object-oriented language. If this technical term does not mean
        anything to you, do not worry, all you need to remember at this point is that all the code you write must be
        held in a Java class.</p>
    <h1 class="txt txt1 txt3">Preparing the Compilation of your First Class</h1>
    <p class="txt blk blk1 wrd3">Compiling is the second step you need to follow after the creation of your first class.
        It consists of transforming the Java code you wrote in your MyFirstClass.java file into another format that can
        be executed. The result of this transformation will be stored in another file created by the compiler. The name
        of this file will be MyFirstClass.class.</p>
